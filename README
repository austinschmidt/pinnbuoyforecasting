Jupyter Notebooks containing Python code for generating a dataset from HYCOM, ERA5, and raw buoy data for the purpose of buoy ocean feature forecasting. 
Using PINNs, we show regularization from ocean models can result in more performant forecasting.

The files included are:

1) station_lists.txt -> The full list of buoys considered and their lat/lon coordinates.

2) BuoyChecking.ipynb -> Takes raw buoy data, HYCOM data (not included) and ERA5 data (not included) and produces a single dataset for 2011 (included).

3-5) Buoy Forecasting Tests -> Code which trains/runs/tests and allows modifications to be made for collecting test results. 
     With the provided data and proper Python libraries, an interactive model training interface makes test usage more clear. 
     
6) FullHorizonPlotting.ipynb -> Hard coded figures for final results staging.

7) Full dataset under ProcessedData folder.

8) All results under the Results folder.
